/*
Zero divisors
a, b != 0 and ab = 0
is a zero divisor if gcd is not 1.
if gcd is 1, then is a member of m's unit ring

ring -> two closed operations, a(b+c) is distributive ab+ac
associative w/ 1 op -> semigroup,
semigroup w/neutral elem -> monoid,
monoid and every elem is invertable -> group,
group and commutative -> abelian group,

modular integers form a ring



Euler phi function: ZZ => ZZ
                     a -> magnitude of (aZZ)*

for prime p, phi(p) = p - 1 trivially

3**12 = x + 26ZZ
as phi(26)

Fermat Little => a ^ phi(m) = 1 in groups

cyclic groups (and cyclic subgroups) are generated (completely) by 1 elem and are abelian groups by defun. This one elem is a generators. Generators are coprime to modulo base. The order of an element is the power it must be raised to in order to be congruent to 1. Order of any elem must be a factor of the group order.
